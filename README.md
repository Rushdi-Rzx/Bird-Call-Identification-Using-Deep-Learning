This project aims to classify bird species based on their audio calls. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve this classification.

## Introduction
The Bird Sound Classifier is a machine learning project that identifies bird species from audio recordings. It uses deep learning techniques to process audio data and predict the species of the bird.

## Features
- Load and preprocess audio data
- Data augmentation for robust training
- CNN model for audio classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Web interface for user-friendly interaction

## How to Run

Download the Bird-Call-Identification-Using-Deep-Learning/Bird_Call_Identifier (Python Project)/pythonProject6 folder and run app.py python file.
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the interface.

(NOTE :- pydub, librosa, tensorflow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tqdm and flask packages are needed to run the program.)
