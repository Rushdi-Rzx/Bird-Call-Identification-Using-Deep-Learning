## Introduction
The Bird Sound Classifier is a machine learning project that identifies bird species from audio recordings. It uses deep learning techniques to process audio data and predict the species of the bird.

## Features
- Load and preprocess audio data
- Data augmentation for robust training
- CNN model for audio classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Web interface for user-friendly interaction

## Installation
To run this project locally, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-sound-classifier.git
    cd bird-sound-classifier
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install additional dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install pydub librosa tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
    ```

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Data**: Ensure your dataset is organized with separate folders for each bird species containing their audio files.
2. **Run Model Training**: Use the provided script to train the model on your dataset.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: Check the model's performance using the test dataset.
4. **Run the Web Interface**: Launch the web interface to classify new bird calls.

## Data
The dataset should be organized as follows:
